Everyone in your team has access to the same repo.\n\n-   Go to the [sta210-fa22](https://www.github.com/sta210-fa22) organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-06**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\n\n-   Each person on the team should clone the repository and open a new project in RStudio. Throughout the lab, each person should get a chance to make commits and push to the repo.\n\n## Workflow: Using Git and GitHub as a team\n\n::: callout-important\nThere are no Team Member markers in this lab; however, you should use a similar workflow as in Lab 04. Only one person should type in the group's Qmd file at a time. Once that person has finished typing the group's responses, they should *render, commit, and push* the changes to GitHub. All other teammates can *pull* to see the updates in RStudio.\n\nEvery teammate must have at least one commit in the lab. Everyone is expected to contribute to discussion even when they are not typing.\n:::\n\n## Packages\n\nThe following packages are used in the lab.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n# add other packages as needed\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Data: Palmer Penguins\n\nWe will go back to the Palmer penguins data used in [HW 02.](../hw/hw-02.html)\n\nData were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/). [@gorman2014]\n\n\\\nThese data can be found in the **palmerpenguins** package. We're going to be working with the `penguins` dataset from this package. The dataset contains data for 344 penguins. There are 3 different species of penguins in this dataset, collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. [Click here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html) to see the codebook.\n\nWe will focus on the following variables: \\\n\n| variable      | class   | description                                      |\n|:--------------|:--------|:-------------------------------------------------|\n| species       | integer | Penguin species (Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap)      |\n| island        | integer | Island where recorded (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen) |\n| bill_depth_mm | integer | Bill depth in mm                                 |\n\n## Exercises\n\nThe goal of this analysis is to use logistic regression to understand the relationship between bill depth, island, and whether a penguin is from the Adelie species. First, we need to create a new response variable to identify whether a penguin is from the Adelie species.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npenguins <- penguins |>\n  mutate(adelie = factor(if_else(species == \"Adelie\", 1, 0)))\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd let\\'s check to make sure the new variable looks how we would expect before we continue with the analysis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npenguins |> \n  count(adelie, species)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  adelie species       n\n  <fct>  <fct>     <int>\n1 0      Chinstrap    68\n2 0      Gentoo      124\n3 1      Adelie      152\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Exercise 1\n\nLet's start by examining the relationship between `adelie` and `island`.\n\nVisualize the relationship between `adelie` and `island`. What is something you observe about the relationship between these two variables based on the plot?\n\n::: callout-tip\nIf you need inspiration, [click here](https://r-graph-gallery.com/48-grouped-barplot-with-ggplot2) for example plots and code to visualize the relationship between two categorical variables.\n:::\n\n### Exercise 2\n\nWhat does the `values_fill` argument do in the following chunk? The [documentation](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_wider.html) for the function will be helpful in answering this question.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npenguins |>\n  count(island, adelie) |>\n  pivot_wider(names_from = adelie, values_from = n, values_fill = 0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  island      `0`   `1`\n  <fct>     <int> <int>\n1 Biscoe      124    44\n2 Dream        68    56\n3 Torgersen     0    52\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Exercise 3\n\n-   Calculate the probability a randomly selected penguin is from the Adelie species if it was recorded on Biscoe island.\n\n-   Calculate the odds a randomly selected penguin is from the Adelie species if it was recorded on Biscoe island?\n\n### Exercise 4\n\nYou want to fit a model using `island` to predict the odds of being from the Adelie species. Let $\\pi$ be the probability a penguin is from the Adelie species. The model has the form shown below.\n\n\n$$\n\\log\\Big(\\frac{\\pi}{1-\\pi}\\Big) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1~ Dream + \\beta_2 ~ Torgersen\n$$\n\n\n-   Fit the model and neatly display the model output using three digits.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n\n-   What are the **odds** of a penguin being from the Adelie species if it was recorded on Dream island?\n\n-   What are the **odds** of a penguin being from the Adelie species if it was recorded on Biscoe island?\n\n### Exercise 5\n\nNext, we'd like to add bill depth to the model. We'll start by examining the relationship between `bill_depth_mm` and `adelie`.\n\nVisualize the relationship between these two variables. What is something you observe about the relationship between these two variables based on the plot?\n\n### Exercise 6\n\n-   Next, add bill depth to the previous model so that there are two predictors, `island` and `bill_depth_mm`. Neatly display the model output using three digits.\n\n-   Write the regression equation for the model.\n\n### Exercise 7\n\n-   How do you expect the **log-odds** of being from the Adelie species to change when going from a penguin with bill depth 17 mm to a penguin with bill depth 20 mm? Assume both penguins were recorded on the Dream island.\n\n-   How do you expect the **odds** of being from the Adelie species to change when going from a penguin with bill depth 17 mm to a penguin with bill depth 20 mm? Assume both penguins were recorded on the Dream island.\n\n### Exercise 8\n\n-   How do you expect the **log-odds** of being from the Adelie species to change when going from a penguin with bill depth 18 mm recorded on Biscoe island to a penguin with bill depth 21 mm recorded on Dream island?\n\n-   How do you expect the **odds** of being from the Adelie species to change when going from a penguin with bill depth 18 mm recorded on Biscoe island to a penguin with bill depth 21 mm recorded on Dream island?\n\n## Submission\n\n::: callout-warning\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo.

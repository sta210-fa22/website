## Introduction

In this assignment, you'll get to put into practice the logistic regression skills you've developed to analyze data about Palmer Penguins.

### Learning goals

By the end of the lab you will be able to

-   conduct exploratory data analysis for logistic regression
-   fit logistic regression models and write the regression equation
-   use the model to calculate predicted probabilities
-   continue developing a collaborative workflow with your teammates

## Getting started

-   A repository has already been created for you and your teammates. Everyone in your team has access to the same repo.

-   Go to the [sta210-fa22](https://www.github.com/sta210-fa22) organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-06**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.

-   Each person on the team should clone the repository and open a new project in RStudio. Throughout the lab, each person should get a chance to make commits and push to the repo.

## Workflow: Using Git and GitHub as a team

::: callout-important
There are no Team Member markers in this lab; however, you should use a similar workflow as in Lab 04. Only one person should type in the group's Qmd file at a time. Once that person has finished typing the group's responses, they should *render, commit, and push* the changes to GitHub. All other teammates can *pull* to see the updates in RStudio.

Every teammate must have at least one commit in the lab. Everyone is expected to contribute to discussion even when they are not typing.

## Packages

The following packages are used in the lab.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false
#| eval: true

library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(knitr)

# add other packages as needed
```

## Data: Palmer Penguins

We will go back to the Palmer penguins data used in [HW 02.](../hw/hw-02.html)

Data were collected and made available by [Dr.Â Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/). [@gorman2014]

\
These data can be found in the **palmerpenguins** package. We're going to be working with the `penguins` dataset from this package. The dataset contains data for 344 penguins. There are 3 different species of penguins in this dataset, collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. [Click here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html) to see the codebook.

We will focus on the following variables:\

| variable        | class   | description                                      |
|:---------------|:---------------|:---------------------------------------|
| `species`       | integer | Penguin species (Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap)      |
| `island`        | integer | Island where recorded (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen) |
| `bill_depth_mm` | integer | Bill depth in mm                                 |

## Exercises

The goal of this analysis is to use logistic regression to understand the relationship between bill depth, island, and whether a penguin is from the Adelie species. First, we need to create a new response variable to identify whether a penguin is from the Adelie species.

```{r}
penguins <- penguins |>
  mutate(adelie = factor(if_else(species == "Adelie", 1, 0)))
```

And let's check to make sure the new variable looks how we would expect before we continue with the analysis.

```{r}
penguins |> 
  count(adelie, species)
```

### Exercise 1

Let's start by examining the relationship between `adelie` and `island`.

Visualize the relationship between `adelie` and `island`. What is something you observe about the relationship between these two variables based on the plot?

### Exercise 2

What does the `values_fill` argument do in the following chunk? The [documentation](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_wider.html) for the function will be helpful in answering this question.

```{r}
penguins |>
  count(island, adelie) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = adelie, values_from = n, values_fill = 0)
```

### Exercise 3

-   Calculate the **probability** a randomly selected penguin is from the Adelie species if it was recorded on Biscoe island.

-   Calculate the **odds** a randomly selected penguin is from the Adelie species if it was recorded on Biscoe island.

### Exercise 4

You want to fit a model using `island` to predict the odds of being from the Adelie species. Let $\pi$ be the probability a penguin is from the Adelie species. The model has the form shown below.

$$
\log\Big(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\Big) = \beta_0 + \beta_1~ Dream + \beta_2 ~ Torgersen
$$

-   Fit the model and neatly display the model output using three digits.

<!-- -->

-   What are the predicted **odds** of a penguin being from the Adelie species if it was recorded on Biscoe island?

-   What are the predicted **odds** of a penguin being from the Adelie species if it was recorded on Dream island?

### Exercise 5

Next, we'd like to add bill depth to the model. We'll start by examining the relationship between these two variables.

Visualize the relationship between `bill_depth_mm` and `adelie`. What is something you observe about the relationship between these two variables based on the plot?

### Exercise 6

-   Add bill depth to the previous model so that there are two predictors, `island` and `bill_depth_mm`. Neatly display the model output using three digits.

-   Write the estimated regression equation.

### Exercise 7

Use the model from Exercise 6.

-   How do you expect the **log-odds** of being from the Adelie species to change when going from a penguin with bill depth 17 mm to a penguin with bill depth 20 mm? Assume both penguins were recorded on the Dream island.

-   How do you expect the **odds** of being from the Adelie species to change when going from a penguin with bill depth 17 mm to a penguin with bill depth 20 mm? Assume both penguins were recorded on the Dream island.

### Exercise 8

Use the model from Exercise 6.

-   How do you expect the **log-odds** of being from the Adelie species to change when going from a penguin with bill depth 18 mm recorded on Biscoe island to a penguin with bill depth 21 mm recorded on Dream island?

-   How do you expect the **odds** of being from the Adelie species to change when going from a penguin with bill depth 18 mm recorded on Biscoe island to a penguin with bill depth 21 mm recorded on Dream island?

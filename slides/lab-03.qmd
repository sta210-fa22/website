## Reminders {.midi}

Make sure to do the following as you complete the assignment:

-   Write all narrative in complete sentences.

-   Use informative axis titles and labels on all graphs.

-   Implement version control in your reproducible workflow.

    -   Throughout the assignment periodically **render** your Quarto document to produce the updated PDF, **commit** the changes in the Git pane, and **push** the updated files to GitHub.

    -   Aim to push changes to GitHub at least three times as you work on the assignment.

## Today's lab

-   Remember to use a reproducible workflow with regular commits (and informative commit messages).

    -   Push all updated files after each commit!

-   Use lectures and AEs from [Week 04](../weeks/week-04.qmd) as reference as you complete the lab.\

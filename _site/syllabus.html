<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inclusive-community">Inclusive community</h3>
<p>It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with <a href="https://provost.duke.edu/initiatives/commitment-to-diversity-and-inclusion">Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion</a>. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.</li>
<li>I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a member of the teaching team know.</li>

</section>
<section id="lectures-and-labs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lectures-and-labs">Lectures and labs</h2>
<p>The goal of both the lectures and the labs is for them to be as interactive as possible. My role as instructor is to introduce you new tools and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to prepare for lectures by completing assigned readings, attend all lecture and lab sessions, and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded for completion.</p>
<p>You are expected to bring a laptop, tablet, or Chromebook to each class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises. Please make sure your device is fully charged before you come to class as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone.</p>
</section>
<section id="teams" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="teams">Teams</h2>
<p>You will be assigned to a team at the beginning of the semester. You are encouraged to sit with your teammates in lecture and you will also work with them in the lab sessions. All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of the labs and project and you will be asked to evaluate your team members throughout the semester. Failure to adequately contribute to an assignment will result in a penalty to your mark relative to the team’s overall mark.</p>
<p>You are expected to make use of the provided GitHub repository as their central collaborative platform. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric (one of several) of each team member’s relative contribution for each project.</p>
</section>
<section id="activities-assessment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="activities-assessment">Activities &amp; Assessment</h2>
<p>You will be assessed based on six components: application exercises, homework, labs, exams, project, and teamwork.</p>
<section id="application-exercises" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="application-exercises">Application Exercises</h3>
<p>Parts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the prepare assignment. These AEs are due within three days of the corresponding lecture period. Specifically, AEs from Monday lectures are due Thursday by 11:59p ET, and AEs from Wednesday lectures are due Saturday by 11:59p ET.</p>
<p>Because these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.</p>
</section>
<section id="labs" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="labs">Labs</h3>
<p>In labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation. Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team’s Git repository on the course’s GitHub page as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member’s relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.</p>
<p><em>The lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="homework" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="homework">Homework</h3>
<p>In homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.</p>
<p>One homework assignment will be dedicated to a <em>statistics experience</em>. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.</p>
<p><em>The lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="exams" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exams">Exams</h3>
<p>There will be two take-home, open-note exams. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The content of the exam will be related to the content in reading assignments, lectures, application exercises, homeworks, and labs. More detail about the exams will be given during the semester.</p>
</section>
<section id="project" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="project">Project</h3>
<p>The purpose of the <a href="./project/">final project</a> is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work in video and in writing during the final exam period. More information about the project will be provided during the semester.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="five-tips-for-success">Five tips for success</h2>
<p>Your success on this course depends very much on you and the effort you put into it. The course has been organized so that the burden of learning is on you. Your TAs and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Complete all the preparation work before class.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.</p></li>
<li><p>Do the readings.</p></li>
<li><p>Do the homework and lab.The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t procrastinate. The content builds upon what was taught in previous weeks, so if something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, etc. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours and work with a member of the teaching team to help you identify a good (re)starting point.</p></li>

<p>Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.</p></li>
<li><p>For the projects and team labs, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project or team labs across teams.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reusing code</strong>: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g.&nbsp;StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.</p></li>

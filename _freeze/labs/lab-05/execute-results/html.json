Everyone in your team has access to the same repo.\n-   Go to the [sta210-fa22](https://www.github.com/sta210-fa22) organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-05**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\n-   Each person on the team should clone the repository and open a new project in RStudio. Throughout the lab, each person should get a chance to make commits and push to the repo.\n-   **Do not make any changes to the `.qmd` file until the instructions tell you do to so.**\n\n## Workflow: Using Git and GitHub as a team\n\n::: callout-important\nThere are no Team Member markers in this lab; however, you should use a similar workflow as in Lab 04. Only one person should type in the group's Qmd file at a time. Once that person has finished typing the group's responses, they should *render, commit, and push* the changes to GitHub. All other teammates can *pull* to see the updates in RStudio.\n\nEvery teammate must have at least one commit in the lab. Everyone is expected to contribute to discussion even when they are not typing.\n:::\n\n## Packages\n\nThe following packages are used in the lab.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(fivethirtyeight)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n# add other packages as needed\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Data: Candy\n\nThe data from this lab comes from the the article FiveThirtyEight [*The Ultimate Halloween Candy Power Ranking*](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking) by Walt Hickey. To collect data, Hickey and collaborators at FiveThirtyEight set up an experiment people could vote on a series of randomly generated candy matchups (e.g. Reeses vs. Skittles). Click [here](http://walthickey.com/2017/10/18/whats-the-best-halloween-candy/) to check out some of the match ups.\n\nThe data set contains the characteristics and win percentage from 85 candies in the experiment. The variables are\n\n| Variable           | Description                                                               |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `chocolate`        | Does it contain chocolate?                                                |\n| `fruity`           | Is it fruit flavored?                                                     |\n| `caramel`          | Is there caramel in the candy?                                            |\n| `peanutalmondy`    | Does it contain peanuts, peanut butter or almonds?                        |\n| `nougat`           | Does it contain nougat?                                                   |\n| `crispedricewafer` | Does it contain crisped rice, wafers, or a cookie component?              |\n| `hard`             | Is it a hard candy?                                                       |\n| `bar`              | Is it a candy bar?                                                        |\n| `pluribus`         | Is it one of many candies in a bag or box?                                |\n| `sugarpercent`     | The percentile of sugar it falls under within the data set.

Name the data sets `candy_train` and `candy_test`, respectively. Use `set.seed(1)`.\n\n::: callout-tip\nUse the `prop =` argument in the `initial_split()` function to specify the proportion of observations in the training data.\n:::\n\n### Exercise 2\n\nBelow is a recipe for a model that uses the characteristics of candy to understand variability in the win percentage. The lines of the `recipe` code are labeled *Line 1* - *Line 8.* Describe what each line of code does. The explanation should be written comprehensively and specifically enough that someone could replicate the data manipulation steps based on your description.\n\nFor example, if a line of code is `step_center(X)`, a comprehensive and specific explanation something similar to the following: \"This line of code mean centers the variable $X$ by subtracting $\\bar{X}$ from each value of $X$ in the training data.\"\n\n::: callout-tip\nUse the [Recipes Function Reference](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/reference/index.html) page as a resource to learn more about the `step_` functions.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Line 1\ncandy_rec <- recipe(winpercent ~ ., data = candy_train) |> \n#Line 2\n  update_role(competitorname, new_role = \"ID\") |> \n# Line 3\n  step_cut(sugarpercent, breaks = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,1)) |> \n#Line 4\n  step_mutate(pricepercent = pricepercent * 100) |> \n#Line 5\n  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) |> \n#Line 6\n  step_interact(terms =~ pricepercent:chocolate) |> \n#Line 7\n  step_rm(fruity, caramel, peanutyalmondy, nougat, hard, bar, pluribus, crispedricewafer) |> \n#Line 8\n  step_zv(all_predictors()) \n```\n:::\n\n\n### Exercise 3\n\nFill in the code to use `prep` and `bake` for a preview of what will happen when the recipe in Exercise 2 is applied.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncandy_rec |>\n  prep() |>\n  bake(_____) |>\n  glimpse()\n```\n:::\n\n\nHow many terms (not including the intercept) will be in the model produced by this recipe?\n\n### Exercise 4\n\nSpecify the model, build the model workflow using the recipe in Exercise 2, and fit the model to the training data. Neatly display the model using 3 digits.\n\n### Exercise 5\n\nInterpret the following in the context of the data:\n\n-   Intercept\n\n-   Coefficient of `sugarpercent_X.0.75.1.`\n\n-   Coefficient of `pricepercent_x_chocolateTRUE`\n\n### Exercise 6\n\nLet's consider another model. Use the `recipe()` workflow to fit a new model that meets the following criteria:\n\n-   Includes variables `chocolate`, `pricepercent`, `crispedricewafer`, `pluribus, sugarpercent`\n\n-   Update `pricepercent` so it ranges from 0 to 100 (instead of 0 to 1)\n\n-   Makes `sugarpercent` a factor where the levels equal the four quartiles: 0 - 0.25, 0.25 - 0.50, 0.50 - 0.75, 0.75 - 1\n\n-   Includes the interaction between `pricepercent` and `pluribus`\n\nNeatly display the model using 3 digits.\n\n### Exercise 7\n\nCalculate $R^2$, Adjusted $R^2$, AIC, and BIC for the models fit in Exercise 4 and the Exercise 6.\n\n### Exercise 8\n\nConsider the model from Exercise 4 \"Model 1\" and the model fit in Exercise 6 \"Model 2\". State the model you would select based on each of the criteria below. Briefly explain your response.\n\n-   $R^2$\n\n-   Adjusted $R^2$\n\n-   AIC\n\n-   BIC\n\n### Exercise 9\n\nUse RMSE to evaluate the predictive performance of each model on the testing data. Which model would you choose based on RMSE?\n\n### Exercise 10\n\n-   Which model do you choose after taking into account all the model evaluation statistics in Exercises 9 and 10? Briefly explain your response.\n\n-   Use the model you selected to describe what generally makes a good candy, i.e., one with a high win percentage.\n\n## Submission\n\n::: callout-warning\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo.

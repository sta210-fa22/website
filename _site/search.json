Write the answers to Exercises 1 and 2.\n🙅🏽 All other team members: Hands off the keyboard until otherwise instructed!\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\nIdentify episodes where Halloween, Valentine’s Day, and Christmas are mentioned.\n\nFirst, convert all text to lowercase with the function str_to_lower().\nThen, create three new variables (halloween_mention, valentine_mention, and christmas_mention) that take the value 1 if the character string \"halloween\", \"valentine\", or \"christmas\" appears in the text, respectively, and 0 otherwise.\n\nBelow is code to help you get started.\n\ntheoffice <- theoffice |>\n  mutate(\n    text = ___(text),\n    halloween_mention = if_else(str_detect(text, \"___\"), ___, ___),\n    valentine_mention = ___,\n    ___ = ___\n  )\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nIn this exercise we’ll accomplish two separate tasks. We’re doing both tasks all at once, because we’re going to drastically change our data frame, from one row per line spoken to one row per episode. We’ll call the resulting data frame office_episodes.\nThe two tasks are as follows:\n\nTask 1. Identify episodes where the word “halloween”, “valentine”, or “christmas” were ever mentioned, using variables you created in Exercise 1.\nTask 2. Calculate the percentage of lines spoken by Jim, Pam, Michael, and Dwight for each episode of The Office.\n\nBelow are instructions and starter code to get you started with these tasks.\n\nStart by grouping theoffice data by season, episode, episode_name, imdb_rating, total_votes, and air_date. (These variables, except for season have the same value for each given episode, hence grouping by them allows us to make sure they appear in the output of this pipeline.)\nUse summarize() to calculate the desired features at the season-episode level.\nTask 1:\n\nCalculate the number of lines per season per episode. You can might name this new variable n_lines.\nThen, calculate the proportion of lines in that episode spoken by each of the four characters Jim, Pam, Michael, and Dwight. Name these new variables lines_jim, lines_pam, lines_michael, and lines_dwight, respectively.\n\nTask 2:\n\nCreate a variable called halloween that sums up the 1s in halloween_mention at the season-episode level and takes on the value \"yes\" if the sum is greater than or equal to 1, or \"no\" otherwise.\nDo something similar for new variables valentine and christmas as well based on values from valentine_mention and christmas_mention.\n\nFinish up your summarize() statement by dropping the groups, so the resulting data frame is no longer grouped. Additionally, remove n_lines (we won’t use that variable in our analysis, we only calculated it as an intermediary step).\n\n\noffice_episodes <- theoffice |>\n  group_by(___) |>\n  summarize(\n    n_lines = n(),\n    lines_jim = sum(character == \"___\") / n_lines,\n    lines_pam = ___,\n    lines_michael = ___,\n    lines_dwight = ___,\n    halloween = if_else(sum(___) >= 1, \"yes\", \"no\"),\n    valentine = if_else(___, \"___\", \"___\"),\n    christmas = if_else(___, \"___\", \"___\"),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |>\n  select(-n_lines)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy summarize() and not mutate()? We use mutate() to add / modify a column of a data frame. The output data frame always has the same number of rows as the input data frame. On the other hand, we use summarize() to reduce the data frame to either a single row (single summary statistic) or one row per each group (summary statistics at the group level).\nAnd what about that .groups argument in summarize? You could try running your summarize() step without it first. You’ll see that R print out a message saying “summarize() has grouped output by season, episode. You can override using the .groups argument.” summarize() will only drop the last group. So if you want a data frame that doesn’t have a grouping structure as a result of a summarize(), you can explicitly ask for that with .groups = \"drop\". Before you proceed, read the documentation for summarize(), and specifically the explanation for the .groups argument to prepare yourself for future instances where you might see this type of message.\n\n\n\nTeam Member 1: Render the document and confirm that the changes are visible in the PDF.

Add an indicator variable, michael, that takes on the value \"yes\" if Michael Scott (Steve Carrell) was in the show, and \"no\" if not.\n\noffice_episodes <- office_episodes |>\n  mutate(michael = if_else(season > ___, \"___\", \"___\"))\n\n\n\nExercise 4\nPrint out the dimensions (dim()) of the new data set you created as well as the names() of the columns in the data set.\nYour new data set, office_episodes, should have 186 rows and 14 columns. The column names should be season, episode, episode_name, imdb_rating, total_votes, air_date, lines_jim, lines_pam, lines_michael, lines_dwight, halloween, valentine, christmas, and michael. If you are not matching these numbers or columns, go back and try to figure out where you went wrong. Or ask your TA for help!\n\n\n\nExploratory data analysis\nThis would be a good place to conduct some exploratory data analysis (EDA). For example, plot the proportion of lines spoken by each character over time. Or calculate the percentage of episodes that mention Halloween, or Valentine’s Day, or Christmas. Given we have limited time in the lab we’re not going to ask you to report EDA results as part of this lab, but we’re noting this here to provide suggestions for how you might go about structuring your project.\n\n\nModeling prep\n\nExercise 5\nSplit the data into training (75%) and testing (25%).

Use set.seed(1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nUse the prop = argument in the initial_split() function to specify the proportion of observations in the training data.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nBelow is a recipe for a model that uses the characteristics of candy to understand variability in the win percentage. The lines of the recipe code are labeled Line 1 - Line 8. Describe what each line of code does. The explanation should be written comprehensively and specifically enough that someone could replicate the data manipulation steps based on your description.\nFor example, if a line of code is step_center(X), a comprehensive and specific explanation something similar to the following: “This line of code mean centers the variable \\(X\\) by subtracting \\(\\bar{X}\\) from each value of \\(X\\) in the training data.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nUse the Recipes Function Reference page as a resource to learn more about the step_ functions.\n\n\n\n#Line 1\ncandy_rec <- recipe(winpercent ~ ., data = candy_train) |> \n#Line 2\n  update_role(competitorname, new_role = \"ID\") |> \n# Line 3\n  step_cut(sugarpercent, breaks = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,1)) |> \n#Line 4\n  step_mutate(pricepercent = pricepercent * 100) |> \n#Line 5\n  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) |> \n#Line 6\n  step_interact(terms =~ pricepercent:chocolate) |> \n#Line 7\n  step_rm(fruity, caramel, peanutyalmondy, nougat, hard, bar, pluribus, crispedricewafer) |> \n#Line 8\n  step_zv(all_predictors()) \n\n\n\nExercise 3\nFill in the code to use prep and bake for a preview of what will happen when the recipe in Exercise 2 is applied.\n\ncandy_rec |>\n  prep() |>\n  bake(_____) |>\n  glimpse()\n\nHow many terms (not including the intercept) will be in the model produced by this recipe?\n\n\nExercise 4\nSpecify the model, build the model workflow using the recipe in Exercise 2, and fit the model to the training data.

Use the recipe() workflow to fit a new model that meets the following criteria:\n\nIncludes variables chocolate, pricepercent, crispedricewafer, pluribus, sugarpercent\nUpdate pricepercent so it ranges from 0 to 100 (instead of 0 to 1)\nMakes sugarpercent a factor where the levels equal the four quartiles: 0 - 0.25, 0.25 - 0.50, 0.50 - 0.75, 0.75 - 1\nIncludes the interaction between pricepercent and pluribus\n\nNeatly display the model using 3 digits.\n\n\nExercise 7\nCalculate \\(R^2\\), Adjusted \\(R^2\\), AIC, and BIC for the models fit in Exercise 4 and the Exercise 6.\n\n\nExercise 8\nConsider the model from Exercise 4 “Model 1” and the model fit in Exercise 6 “Model 2”. State the model you would select based on each of the criteria below. Briefly explain your response.\n\n\\(R^2\\)\nAdjusted \\(R^2\\)\nAIC\nBIC\n\n\n\nExercise 9\nUse RMSE to evaluate the predictive performance of each model on the testing data. Which model would you choose based on RMSE?\n\n\nExercise 10\n\nWhich model do you choose after taking into account all the model evaluation statistics in Exercises 9 and 10?

    "text": "Topic ideas\n\ndue Monday, October 17 (Thursday labs)\ndue Tuesday, October 18 (Friday labs)\n\nProject proposal due Friday, November 4\nRound 1 submission (optional) due Friday, November 18\nWritten report due Friday, December 9 (accepted until December 11)\nVideo presentation + slides and Reproducibility + organization due Wednesday, December 14\nPresentation comments due Friday, December 16\n\n\nTL;DR: Pick a data set and do a regression analysis. That is your final project.\nThe goal of the final project is for you to use regression analysis to analyze a data set of your own choosing. The data set may already exist or you may collect your own data by scraping the web.\nChoose the data based on your group’s interests or work you all have done in other courses or research projects. The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like!) and apply them to a data set to analyze it in a meaningful way.\nAll analyses must be done in RStudio, and all components of the project must be reproducible (with the exception of the presentation).\n\n\nYou will work on the project with your lab groups.\nThe four primary deliverables for the final project are\n\nA written, reproducible report detailing your analysis\nA GitHub repository corresponding to your report\nSlides + a video presentation\nFormal peer review on another team’s project\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify 2 - 3 data sets you’re interested in potentially using for the final project. If you’re unsure where to find data, you can use the list of potential data sources on the Tips + resources page as a starting point. It may also help to think of topics you’re interested in investigating and find data sets on those topics.\nThe purpose of submitting project ideas is to give you time to find data for the project and to make sure you have a data set that can help set you up for a successful project. Therefore, you must use one of the data sets submitted as a topic idea, unless otherwise notified by the teaching team.\nThe data sets should meet the following criteria:\n\nAt least 500 observations\nAt least 10 columns\nAt least 6 of the columns must be useful and unique predictor variables.\n\nIdentifier variables such as “name”, “social security number”, etc. are not useful predictor variables.\nIf you have multiple columns with the same information (e.g. “state abbreviation” and “state name”), then they are not unique predictors.\n\nAt least one variable that can be identified as a reasonable response variable.\n\nThe response variable can be quantitative or categorical.\n\nA mix of quantitative and categorical variables that can be used as predictors.\nObservations should reasonably meet the independence condition. Therefore, avoid data with repeated measures, data collected over time, etc.\nYou may not use data that has previously been used in any course materials, or any derivation of data that has been used in course materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAsk a member of the teaching team if you’re unsure whether your data set meets the criteria.\n\n\nFor each data set, include the following:\n\n\n\nState the source of the data set.\nDescribe when and how it was originally collected (by the original data curator, not necessarily how you found the data)\nDescribe the observations and the general characteristics being measured in the data\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe a research question you’re interested in answering using this data.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the glimpse function to provide an overview of the data set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll work will go inside the topic-ideas folder. Write your responses in topic-ideas.qmd and put the data sets in the data folder within topic-ideas.\n\nSubmit the PDF of the topic ideas to Gradescope. Mark all pages associated with each data set.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Topic Ideas portion of the project is worth 10 points. It will be graded based on meeting the criteria stated above for 2 proposed data sets.\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the project proposal is to help you think about your analysis strategy early and thoroughly explore the data.\nInclude the following in the proposal:\n\n\nThe introduction section includes\n\nan introduction to the subject matter you’re investigating\nthe motivation for your research question (citing any relevant literature)\nthe primary research question you are interested in exploring\nyour team’s hypotheses regarding the research question\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will describe the data set. This includes\n\ndescription of the observations in the data set\ndescription of how the data were originally collected (not how you found the data but how the original curator of the data collected it).\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will explore the data. This includes using visualizations and summary statistics to describe the following:\n\nunivariate distribution of the response variable\nunivariate distributions of the potential predictor variables\nrelationships between the response and predictors\nrelationships between predictors\npotential interaction effects you’re interested in exploring\n\nIn this section, you will also describe any data cleaning you need to do to prepare for modeling, such as imputing missing values, collapsing levels for categorical predictors, creating new variables, summarizing data, etc.\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will provide a brief overview of your analysis approach. This includes:\n\ndescription of the response variable and list of potential predictors\nregression model technique (multiple linear regression or logistic regression)\n\n\n\n\nSubmit a data dictionary for all the variables in your data set in the README of the data folder. You do not need to include the data dictionary in the PDF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll work will go inside the proposal folder. Write your responses in proposal.qmd and put the data set and the data dictionary in the data folder.\n\nSubmit the PDF of the proposal to Gradescope. Mark all pages of the document.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe anticipated length, including all graphs, tables, narrative, etc., is 3 - 6 pages; it may not exceed 7 pages.\nThe proposal is with 15 points and will be graded based on accurately and comprehensively addressing the criteria stated above. Points will be assigned based on a holistic review of the project proposal.\n\nExcellent (14 - 15 points) : All required elements are completed and are accurate. There is a thorough exploration of the data and the team has demonstrated a careful and thoughtful approach exploring the data and preparing it for analysis. The narrative is written clearly, all tables and visualizations are nicely formatted, and the work would be presentable in a professional setting.\nStrong: (11 - 13 points) Requirements are mostly met, but there are some elements that are incomplete or inaccurate. Some minor revision of the work required before team is ready for modeling.\nSatisfactory (8 - 10 points): Requirements partially met, but there are some elements that are incomplete and/or inaccurate. Major revision of the work required before team is ready for modeling.\nNeeds Improvement (7 or fewer points points): Requirements are largely unmet, and there are large elements that are incomplete and/or inaccurate. Substantial revisions of the work required before team is ready for modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Round 1 submission is an opportunity to receive feedback on your analysis and written report. The feedback will only be on the content that is submitted, so more “complete” drafts will receive more detailed feedback. At this stage, you will also be notified of the grade you would receive at that point. You will have the option to keep the grade (and thus you don’t need to turn in an updated report) or resubmit the written report by the final submission deadline for grading.\nTo submit the draft:\n1. Push the updated written-report.qmd and written-report.pdf to your GitHub repo.\n2. Open an issue with the title “Round 1 Submission”. You can use the template issue in the GitHub repo. Make sure I am tagged in the issue (@matackett), so I receive notification of your Round 1 submission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou must complete both steps to submit the draft.\n\n\nThe draft must be submitted by Friday, November 18 at 11:59pm to receive preliminary feedback. Reports submitted after that date will not receive preliminary feedback.\nNote that this is optional, so there is no penalty for turning in nothing for the Round 1 submission.\n\n\n\nYour written report must be completed in the written-report.qmd file and must be reproducible. All team members should contribute to the GitHub repository, with regular meaningful commits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBefore you finalize your write up, make sure the code chunks are not visible and all messages and warnings are suppressed.\n\n\nYou will submit the PDF of your final report on Gradescope.\nThe PDF you submit must match the files in your GitHub repository exactly. The mandatory components of the report are below. You are free to add additional sections as necessary. The report, including visualizations, should be no more than 10 pages long. is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the analysis and report.\nBe selective in what you include in your final write-up. The goal is to write a cohesive narrative that demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive analysis rather than explain every step of the analysis.\nYou are welcome to include an appendix with additional work at the end of the written report document; however, grading will largely be based on the content in the main body of the report. You should assume the reader will not see the material in the appendix unless prompted to view it in the main body of the report. The appendix should be neatly formatted and easy for the reader to navigate. It is not included in the 10-page limit.\n\n\nThis section includes an introduction to the project motivation, data, and research question. Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the written report, your team will also create presentation slides and record a video presentation that summarize and showcase your project. Introduce your research question and data set, showcase visualizations, and discuss the primary conclusions. These slides should serve as a brief visual addition to your written report and will be graded for content and quality.\nFor submission, convert these slides to a .pdf document, and submit the PDF of the slides on Gradescope.\nThe slide deck should have no more than 6 content slides + 1 title slide. Here is a suggested outline as you think through the slides; you do not have to use this exact format for the 6 slides.\n\nTitle Slide\nSlide 1: Introduce the topic and motivation\nSlide 2: Introduce the data\nSlide 3: Highlights from EDA\nSlide 4: Final model\nSlide 5: Interesting findings from the model\nSlide 6: Conclusions + future work\n\n\n\n\nFor the video presentation, you can speak over your slide deck, similar to the lecture content videos. The video presentation must be no longer than 8 minutes. It is fine if the video is shorter than 8 minutes, but it cannot exceed 8 minutes. You may use can use any platform that works best for your group to record your presentation. Below are a few resources on recording videos:\n\nRecording presentations in Zoom\nApple Quicktime for screen recording\nWindows 10 built-in screen recording functionality\nKap for screen recording\n\nOnce your video is ready, upload the video to Warpwire, then embed the video in an new discussion post on Sakai.\n\n\n\nClick the Warpwire tab in the course Sakai site.\nClick the “+” and select “Upload files”.\nLocate the video on your computer and click to upload.\nOnce you’ve uploaded the video to Warpwire, click to share the video and copy the video’s URL. You will need this when you post the video in the discussion forum.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the Presentations tab in the course Sakai site.\nClick the Presentations topic.\nClick “Start a new conversation”.\nMake the title “Your Team Name: Project Title”. For example, “Teaching Team: Our Awesome Presentation”.\nClick the Warpwire icon (between the table and shopping cart icons).\nSelect your video, then click “Insert 1 item.” This will embed your video in the conversation.\nUnder the video, paste the URL to your video.\nYou’re done!\n\nYou can see the Teaching Team example in Sakai.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach student will be assigned 2 presentations to watch.\nWatch the group’s video, then click “Reply” to post a question for the group. You may not post a question that’s already been asked on the discussion thread. Additionally, the question should be (i) substantive (i.e. it shouldn’t be “Why did you use a bar plot instead of a pie chart”?), (ii) demonstrate your understanding of the content from the course, and (iii) relevant to that group’s specific presentation, i.e demonstrating that you’ve watched the presentation.\nYou may start posting questions and comments on Thursday, December 15. All comments must be posted by Friday, December 16 at 11:59pm.\nThis portion of the project will be assessed individually.\n\n\n\nAll written work (with exception of presentation slides) should be reproducible, and the GitHub repo should be neatly organized.\nThe GitHub repo should have the following structure:\n\nREADME: Short project description and data dictionary\nwritten-report.qmd & written-report.pdf: Final written report\n/data: Folder that contains the data set for the final project.\n/previous-work: Folder that contains the topic-ideas and project-proposal files.\n/presentation: Folder with the presentation slides.\n\nIf your presentation slides are online, you can put a link to the slides in a README.md file in the presentation folder.\n\n\nPoints for reproducibility + organization will be based on the reproducibility of the written report and the organization of the project GitHub repo. The repo should be neatly organized as described above, there should be no extraneous files, all text in the README should be easily readable.\n\n\n\nYou will be asked to fill out a survey where you rate the contribution and teamwork of each team member by assigning a contribution percentage for each team member. Filling out the survey is a prerequisite for getting credit on the team member evaluation. If you are suggesting that an individual did less than half the expected contribution given your team size (e.g., for a team of four students, if a student contributed less than 12.5% of the total effort), please provide some explanation. If any individual gets an average peer score indicating that this was the case, their grade will be assessed accordingly.\n\n\n\nThe grade breakdown is as follows:\n\n\n\nTotal\n100 pts\n\n\n\n\nTopic ideas\n10 pts\n\n\nProject proposal\n15 pts\n\n\nWritten report\n45 pts\n\n\nSlides + video presentation\n15 pts\n\n\nReproducibility + organization\n5 pts\n\n\nVideo comments\n5 pts\n\n\nPeer teamwork evaluation\n5 pts\n\n\n\nNote: No late project reports or videos are accepted.\n\n\nGrading of the project will take into account the following:\n\nContent - What is the quality of research and/or policy question and relevancy of data to those questions?\nCorrectness - Are statistical procedures carried out and explained correctly?\nWriting and Presentation - What is the quality of the statistical presentation, writing, and explanations?\nCreativity and Critical Thought - Is the project carefully thought out? Are the limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into the planning and implementation of the project?\n\nA general breakdown of scoring is as follows:\n\n90%-100%: Outstanding effort. Student understands how to apply all statistical concepts, can put the results into a cogent argument, can identify weaknesses in the argument, and can clearly communicate the results to others.\n80%-89%: Good effort. Student understands most of the concepts, puts together an adequate argument, identifies some weaknesses of their argument, and communicates most results clearly to others.\n70%-79%: Passing effort. Student has misunderstanding of concepts in several areas, has some trouble putting results together in a cogent argument, and communication of results is sometimes unclear.\n60%-69%: Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has misunderstanding of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent argument. Communication of results is unclear.\nBelow 60%: Student is not making a sufficient effort.\n\n\n\n\nThere is no late work accepted on this project. Be sure to turn in your work early to avoid any technological mishaps."

It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or ‘predictors’). More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or ‘criterion variable’) changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.”\n\nSource: Wikipedia (previous definition)"

    "text": "Sum of squares in ANOVA table\nR uses a sequential method to calculate sum of squares for the variables in the model. This means that the sum of squares attributed to each variable is the variation in the response explained by that variable after accounting for the total variation explained by the other variables already in the model.\nThe order of the sequence is determined by the order of the variables in the model fit code. This order is reflected in the order the variables appear in the ANOVA output. The sequential sum of squares attributed to each variable will change if the order of the variables in the model changes; however, the sum of squares attributed to the model overall will not change, regardless of the order of the variables.\nLet’s take a look at the sum of squares for Party, the first variable in the model. This value is calculated as the total variation in Tips explained by Party only. We can calculate this value by looking at the ANOVA table for simple linear regression model where Party is the only predictor.\n\nparty_fit <- linear_reg() |>\n  set_engine(\"lm\") |>\n  fit(Tip ~ Party, data = tips)\n\nanova(party_fit$fit) |>\n  tidy() |>\n  kable(digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\nterm\ndf\nsumsq\nmeansq\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nParty\n1\n1188.64\n1188.64\n274\n0\n\n\nResiduals\n167\n724.47\n4.34\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the sum of squares in this table is the value of \\(SS_{Party}\\) above.\nNext, let’s add Age to the model. The sum of squares associated with Age is the additional variation in Tips explained by Age after accounting for variation explained by Party. This can be understood as the additional model variation in the model with Party and Age compared to a model that only includes Party. We can calculate this additional variation as follows:\n\nanova(party_fit$fit, tip_fit$fit) |>\n  tidy() |>\n  kable(digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\nterm\ndf.residual\nrss\ndf\nsumsq\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nTip ~ Party\n167\n724.47\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nTip ~ Party + Age\n165\n686.44\n2\n38.03\n4.57\n0.01\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the sum of squares in this table is the value of \\(SS_{Age|Party}\\) above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen we input two model is the anova() function, e.g., anova(Model 1, Model 2), the output produced is the additional sum of squares accounted for by the new variable(s) in Model 2 after accounting for the variables in Model 1. In this case, it is the additional sum of squares accounted for by Age after accounting for Party.\n\n\nWhen we use the ANOVA table, we are most interested in the variation in the response explained by the entire model, not the contribution from each variable. Therefore, we will primarily consider the \\(SS_{Model}\\), Sum of Squares Model. Because sum of squares are additive, it can be calculated as\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nSS_{Model} &= SS_{Total} - SS_{Error} \\\\\n&= 1913.11 - 686.44 \\\\\n& = 1226.67\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]It can also be calculated as\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nSS_{Model} &= SS_{Party} + SS_{Age | Party} \\\\\n& = 1188.64 + 38.03 \\\\\n& = 1226.67\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]"

    "text": "Data sources\n\nSome resources that may be helpful as you find data:\n\nR Data Sources for Regression Analysis\nFiveThirtyEight data\nTidyTuesday\n\n\n\nOther data repositories\n\nWorld Health Organization\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research\nInternational Monetary Fund\nGeneral Social Survey\nUnited Nations Data\nUnited Nations Statistics Division\nU.K. Data\nU.S. Data\nU.S. Census Data\nEuropean Statistics\nStatistics Canada\nPew Research\nUNICEF\nCDC\nWorld Bank\nElection Studies\n\n\n\n\nTips\n\nAsk questions if any of the expectations are unclear.\nCode: In your write up your code should be hidden (echo = FALSE) so that your document is neat and easy to read. However your document should include all your code such that if I re-knit your Qmd file I should be able to obtain the results you presented.\n\nException: If you want to highlight something specific about a piece of code, you’re welcome to show that portion.\n\nMerge conflicts will happen, issues will arise, and that’s fine! Commit and push often, and ask questions when stuck.\nMake sure each team member is contributing, both in terms of quality and quantity of contribution (we will be reviewing commits from different team members).\nAll team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of this assignment and group assessments will be given at its completion - anyone judged to not have sufficient contributed to the final product will have their grade penalized. While different teams members may have different backgrounds and abilities, it is the responsibility of every team member to understand how and why all code and approaches in the assignment works.\n\n\n\nFormatting + communication tips\n\nSuppress Code, Warnings, & Messages\n\nInclude the following code in a code chunk at the top of your .qmd file to suppress all code, warnings, and other messages. Use the code chunk header {r set-up, include = FALSE} to suppress this set up code.\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,\n                      warning = FALSE, \n                      message = FALSE)\n\n\nHeaders\n\nUse headers to clearly label each section. Make sure there is a space between the last # and the title, so the header renders correctly. For example, ###Section Title will not render as header, but ### Section Title will.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nInclude all references in a section called “References” at the end of the report.\nThis course does not have specific requirements for formatting citations and references.\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\nIf you have additional work that does not fit or does not belong in the body of the report, you may put it at the end of the document in section called “Appendix”.\nThe items in the appendix should be properly labeled.\nThe appendix should only be for additional material. The reader should be able to fully understand your report without viewing content in the appendix.\n\n\n\nResize figures\n\nResize plots and figures, so you have more space for the narrative.\n\nResize individual figures: Use the code chunk header {r plot1, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}, replacing plot1 with a meaningful label and the height and width with values appropriate for your write up.\nResize all figures: Include the fig_width and fig_height options in your YAML header as shown below:\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Your Title\"\nauthor: \"Team Name + Group Members\"\noutput: \n  pdf_document:\n    fig_width: 5\n    fig_height: 3\n---\nReplace the height and width values with values appropriate for your write up.\n\n\nArranging plots\nArrange plots in a grid, instead of one after the other. This is especially useful when displaying plots for exploratory data analysis and to check assumptions.\n\nIf you’re using ggplot2 functions, the patchwork package makes it easy to arrange plots in a grid. See the documentation and examples here.\nIf you’re using base R function, i.e. when using the emplogit functions, put the code par(mfrow = c(rows,columns)) before the code to make the plots. For example, par(mfrow = c(2,3)) will arrange plots in a grid with 2 rows and 3 columns.\n\n\n\nPlot titles and axis labels\nBe sure all plot titles and axis labels are visible and easy to read.\n\nUse informative titles, not variable names, for titles and axis labels.\nUse coord_flip() to flip the x and y axes on the plot. This is useful if you a bar plot with an x-axis that is difficult to read due to overlapping text.\n\n❌ NO! The x-axis is hard to read because the names overlap.\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n✅ YES! Names are readable\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo a little more to make the plot look professional!\n\nInformative title and axis labels\nFlipped coordinates to make names readable\nArranged bars based on count\nCapitalized manufacturer names\nOptional: Added color - Use a coordinated color scheme throughout paper / presentation\nOptional: Applied a theme - Use same theme throughout paper / presentation\n\n\nmpg |>\n  count(manufacturer) |>\n  mutate(manufacturer = str_to_title(manufacturer)) |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(manufacturer,n), y = n)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x = \"Manufacturer\", \n       y = \"Count\", \n       title = \"The most common manufacturer is Dodge\") +\n  theme_bw() \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables and model output\n\nUse the kable function from the knitr package to neatly output all tables and model output. This will also ensure all model coefficients are displayed.\n\nUse the digits argument to display only 3 or 4 significant digits.\nUse the caption argument to add captions to your table.\n\n\n\nmodel <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)\ntidy(model) |>\n  kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n30.099\n1.634\n18.421\n0\n\n\nhp\n-0.068\n0.010\n-6.742\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines for communicating results\n\nDon’t use variable names in your narrative! Use descriptive terms, so the reader understands your narrative without relying on the data dictionary.\n\n❌ There is a negative linear relationship between mpg and hp.\n✅ There is a negative linear relationship between a car’s fuel economy (in miles per gallon) and its horsepower.\n\nKnow your audience: Your report should be written for a general audience who has an understanding of statistics at the level of STA 210.\nAvoid subject matter jargon: Don’t assume the audience knows all of the specific terminology related to your subject area. If you must use jargon, include a brief definition the first time you introduce a term.\nTell the “so what”: Your report and presentation should be more than a list of interpretations and technical definitions. Focus on what the results mean, i.e. what you want the audience to know about your topic after reading your report or viewing your presentation.\n\n❌ For every one unit increase in horsepower, we expect the miles per gallon to decrease by 0.068 units, on average.\n✅ If the priority is to have good fuel economy, then one should choose a car with lower horsepower. Based on our model, the fuel economy is expected to decrease, on average, by 0.68 miles per gallon for every 10 additional horsepower.\n\nTell a story: All visualizations, tables, model output, and narrative should tell a cohesive story!\nUse one voice: Though multiple people are writing the report, it should read as if it’s from a single author. At least one team member should read through the report before submission to ensure it reads like a cohesive document.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional resources\n\nExploring RStudio’s Visual Markdown Editor\nR for Data Science\nQuarto documentation:\n\nQuarto PDF Basics\nPresentations in Quarto\n\nData visualization\n\nggplot2 Reference\nggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis\nData Visualization: A Practice Introduction\nPatchwork R Package"

Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to prepare for lectures by completing assigned readings, attend all lecture and lab sessions, and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded for completion.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop, tablet, or Chromebook to each class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises.

    "text": "Activities & Assessment\nYou will be assessed based on six components: application exercises, homework, labs, exams, project, and teamwork.\n\nApplication Exercises\nParts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the prepare assignment. These AEs are due within three days of the corresponding lecture period. Specifically, AEs from Monday lectures are due Thursday by 11:59p ET, and AEs from Wednesday lectures are due Saturday by 11:59p ET.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\n\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation. Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team’s Git repository on the course’s GitHub page as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member’s relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a statistics experience. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be two take-home, open-note exams. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The content of the exam will be related to the content in reading assignments, lectures, application exercises, homeworks, and labs. More detail about the exams will be given during the semester.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the final project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work in video and in writing during the final exam period. More information about the project will be provided during the semester."

As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the homework and lab.The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. The content builds upon what was taught in previous weeks, so if something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, etc. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions.

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nAll students must adhere to the Duke Community Standard(DCS): Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, and accountability. Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\nTo uphold the Duke Community Standard, students agree:\n\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;and\nI will act if the Standard is compromised.\n\n\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity(e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources,adhering to guidance around group work projects,and more).Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\n\n\nCollaboration policy\nOnly work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.\nFor the projects and team labs, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project or team labs across teams.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work is accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for labs and homework.\nThe late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email Professor Tackett before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let Professor Tackett know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade Requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final project presentations.\n\n\nClass recordings request\nLectures will be recorded on Panopto and will be made available to students with an excused absence upon request. Videos shared with such students will be available for a week. To request a particular lecture’s video, please fill out the form at https://forms.office.com/r/qU8ANXb6tB.\nPlease also make sure that any official documentation, such as STINFs, Dean’s excuses, NOVAPs, and quarantine/removal from class notices from student health are also uploaded to the form.\nAbout one week before each exam, the class recordings will be available to all students. These videos will be available until the exam deadline.\n\n\n\nAttendance policy\n\nCOVID Symptoms, Exposure, or Infection: Student health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have tested positive for COVID-19or have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested.If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health (dshcheckin@duke.edu, 919-681-9355). Learn more about current university policy related to COVID-19 at coronavirus.duke.edu.\nReligious accommodations: Students are permitted by university policy to be absent from class to observe a religious holiday. Accordingly, Trinity College of Arts & Sciences and the Pratt School of Engineering have established procedures to be followed by students for notifying their instructors of an absence necessitated by the observance of a religious holiday. Please submit requests for religious accommodations at the beginning of the semester so that we can work to make suitable arrangements well ahead of time. You can find the policy and relevant notification form here: trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/religious-holidays"

If there’s a deadline coming up soon, post on the course forum to let us know that there’s an issue. We can look into how quickly it might get resolved and decide on what to do about the deadline accordingly. Note: We don’t anticipate this to happen regularly, the systems are Operational a huge majority of the time!\nIf the status shows Operational, this means the system is expected to be working. Check your internet connection, if need be, restart your computer to ensure a fresh new connection. If your issue persists, post on the course forum with details on what you’ve tried and the errors you see (including verbatim errors and/or screenshots)."
